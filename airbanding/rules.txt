There are no scripts, lines or scenes. <br>
It's just you (and your friends if you want), taking hold of the stage and performing a song of your
choice (which will played in the loud speaker) by mimicking the instruments and/or voice in the song.<br>
You will be judged on showmanship and how well you can mimic all the aspects of the song you're enacting
