<li>What all do I need to bring to the quiz?
<br>Pretty simple, generally a pen and a paper does benefit the participants. Brains are a must. A few participants do feel the need for handkerchiefs. Do feel free to gift one to the organizers if you want to stay a step ahead of the other contenders.</li>

<li>How do I prepare for the Sports Quiz?
<br>Preparing for the sports quiz does not take much time usually. Memorizing this as well as this does benefit the contenders a lot. Learning them wont take much of your time I guess. Memorizing an awful lot about the hundreds of sports generally does not impress the organizers as much as knowing who Joseph Ducreux was or knowing what kind of tattoos look the coolest on you!
