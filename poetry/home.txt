"Poetry is the universal language which the heart holds with nature and itself" -William Hazlitt<br>

<p align="center">Let the muses guide you through the world of fantasy<br>
Soaring to heights<br>
Plucking the wildness of nature or truth of life<br>
Anything and Everything<br>
The heart desires<br>
Pen your poetry<br>
Bring out the poet in you<br>
Gives us THAT thing of beauty, A joy forever<br></p>
