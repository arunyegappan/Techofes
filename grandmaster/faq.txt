<li>What all do I need to bring to the quiz?
<br>Just bring you and your intelligent senses!!!</li>
<br>
<li>Are guesses counted as questions?
<br>First of all, no guesses. You have only one guess. And second, if you get it wrong, you are eliminated. So use your guess with the utmost care.</li>
<li>What if I ask random questions other than yes or no?
<br>First time you'll be given a warning.
