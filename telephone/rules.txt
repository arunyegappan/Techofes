<ul>
<li>A group of 3-5 people per team lined up in a row and turned to the left side of the room</li>
<li>The first person in the line is turned round and the clue is shown to him.</li>
<li>The first person turns around and taps the next person in line on the shoulder. He or she then acts out the clue using classic charades rules(no talking or noise permitted).</li>
<li>Then this continues till the last person and the last person must guess what the exact clue is?? </li>
</ul>
