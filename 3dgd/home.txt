Most gamers would remember the euphoria of taking your first leap of faith (For those of you strandedon an island..the assassin's creed series).  Why? Because that's exactly how it would have been like in real life. Of course, you would have ended up with a mangled body, but in the game you could do it again and again( and trust me..it never gets old).
 The next time you play the latest offering of the phenomenal series gta, take a minute to marvel at the world around the character .Racing cars look more like real cars, sound more like real cars, and handle more like real cars. Trees are now rendered leaf by leaf. The fake world at its best.  But not for long. Games revolutionize every year. What's cool now, may not be in two years. But what will still remain cool...the passion for games. 
And that's where Virscent Technologies(ISO 9001:2008 CERTIFIED) comes and of course, their 3d game designing workshop. For queries you can visit the website www.virscent.com.
