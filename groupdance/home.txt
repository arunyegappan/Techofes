No cultural fest is complete without an amazing group dance event aka Choreonite. Right from B-Boying to the folk dances of the yore,you can expect a mixture of all spread across an evening and not to mention 
all the dancing you get to do off stage.Isn't that awesome? Now,I wish I could go back to my first year and relive 
those moments
