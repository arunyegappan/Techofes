"Better to speak out and remove all doubt than to remain silent and be thought a fool." -Abraham Lincoln <br>

<p align="center">Come young debaters<br>
Use your wits<br>
Quarrel with words not hearts<br>
Manipulate the judges<br>
To make your point a success<br>
To make your stance heard<br>
Enter into the battlefield to WAR WITH WORDS in English Debate</p>
